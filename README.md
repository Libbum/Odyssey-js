# Odyssey
Photoblog of my adventures. Will be essentially static with some pre-processing of images to generate information which the javascript will need.

Using [chromatic.js](https://github.com/crispymtn/chromatic.js) as the gallery back end, may hack on it a bit.

Maps and other interactivity are using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), mostly built specifically for this site, but cobbled together from various internet sources.

## TODO

* [x] Identify Layout 
* [x] Fill cities data
* [ ] Generate 'trips'
* [ ] Integrate map with main site
* [ ] Map colorscheme to site colorscheme
* [ ] Build backend
* [x] File processing
* [x] Manifest for gallery
* [x] Interactive map (wip)
